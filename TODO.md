Features that I can reasonably implement for a library:
[x] Input
    [x] Rewrite controlactions (and include lovelistener by default)
[x] Math helpers
    [x] Numbers: clamp, map, color
[x] 3D
    [x] Copy g3d code, but make it more generalized and work with the linter, especially with mesh creation
[x] Serialization
    [x] General table serialization
